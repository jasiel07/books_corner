      A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images,<br></br> typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and<br></br> protected by a cover.[1] The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices). In the history of hand-held physical supports for<br></br> extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.
